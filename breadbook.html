    <h2>The Bread Book</h2>
    <div class="textstuk">
        <p>For this assignment we were tasked with making a cooking app, which explains each and every step in making a dish. We decided to focus on bakery, like bread or cake. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="textstukje">
        <p>We first made a lo-fi version of how our app was going to look like. The app would have multiple recepies, a way to share or save recepies and also features like a timer</p>

        <img src="fotos/bbmefi.png" alt="">
        <p>The next step was of course trying to improve the look of our app and maybe adding some features or removing some for out me-fi design. After creating this design we tested the application on real people, who would give their suggestions on how to improve.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="textstukje">
        <p>After the tests, we decided on a couple of changes. We decided to add a feature that lets you upload pictures of your food and also decided to remove the timer, as most people found irrelevant to have in the app.</p>
